# Word (DOCX) to PDF Converter

## How to Run

Populate the "WORD" directory with the files you want to convert.

Open the terminal / CMD / Powershell in the original directory address. (The one with the README.)

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python main.py` (or just double click the script.)

The files will be found in the "PDF" directory.

(Btw: you can export dependencies in the environment by using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)
